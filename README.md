# social_network_analysis_project
The first aim of this project was to apply several topics discussed during the course:
- basic characterization of a network;
- community discovery;
- opinion dynamics;
- dynamic network analysis;

to a network built from r/conspiracy, a subreddit of the social network Reddit. 

Moreover, we studied the interactions among users who discuss various
theories in r/conspiracy, classifying them by content analysis
of their comments and posts, and using proclivity and assortativity measures to evaluate preferences in the interactions
between groups discussing different conspiracies.

Note: 
- the final report contains some mistakes.
